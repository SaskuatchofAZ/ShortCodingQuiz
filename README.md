# ShortCodingQuiz

Just a very short coding quiz. Definitely needs some more work
to be fully functional, but it's something. Bugs on the second and thrid questions
probably from running stacked event listeners. High scores save to localStorage.
Score is automatically calculated, and saves on button click. Very much code smell.
